My Metasploit Introduction Notes :-

Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that hackers use to find weakness and attack systems. 
In this TryHackMe room I only learn the very basics. Metasploit mainly have 3 important parts: Exploit, Payload and Auxiliary. 
Exploit is the actual attack code that use the vulnerability in the target system.
Payload is what runs after the exploit success, like reverse shell or meterpreter.
Auxiliary modules are not attacks but for scanning and gathering info, like scanning ports or checking versions.

Metasploit works mostly inside msfconsole, which is the main terminal for using all modules. 
I learned basic commands like search, use, show options, and set for things like RHOSTS and LHOST. 
After setting all options, we run the exploit to try get access.

Meterpreter is a special type of payload that give more control on the target, like file upload, screenshot, etc.
But in this room they only talk very small about it. This room is mainly just an introduction and shows how Metasploit modules are arranged and used.

So overall, I understand only the core idea: Exploit = attack, Payload = action after attack, Auxiliary = scanning tools. 
And msfconsole is where we control everything. That’s mostly what this room teach.
